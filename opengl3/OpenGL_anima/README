This is a README file

things that were added : 	QMatrices for the projection and all the model transformations. 
				handles for all the GL objects
				floats for the user-influenced metrics
				several utility functions with abbriviated names
				implementations for MainView::resizeGL(), MainView::setScale(), MainView::setRotation() and Model::unitize()

things that were changed : 	implementations of ~MainView(), MainView::initializeGL(), MainView::createShaderProgram(), MainView::paintGL()

main issues :			GLSL doesn't tell you when you give the wrong data type in a draw call. A very sneaky issue not found in the dontpanic file.

controls : turn the dials to rotate the figures, slide the slider to resize the objects.

bonus : unitize and IBOs were suggested to be bonus points and were implemented.

Sugestions : 	In the assignement Screenshots are mentioned in the part about handing in and some screenshots are shown in the assignement.
 		The requirement of copying your version of those screenshots is not found in the assignement itslef or on the page. Only in the rules and assessment page.
		This might cause people to miss it, as it almost did with us.
